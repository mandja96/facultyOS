# facultyOS
This repository represents homework assignments from a course called Operating Systems. 

Instructions:
Compile (using gcc compiler):
    example using Linux OS from terminal:
       gcc -std=c99 fshell.c

Run/Execute (a.out that gcc made):
       ./a.out 

Try making new file:
       ./a.out
       mkfile example.txt
       exit                         /*this command will close the program*/
 /* This will make "example.txt" file in the current directory. */

Instead "mkfile" you can try:
        mkdir, cp, rm, rmdir, info, insert, cat.
