# facultyOS
This repository represents homework assignments from a course called Operating Systems. 

Compile (using gcc compiler). 
Example using Linux OS from terminal:  

    gcc -std=c99 fshell.c

Run/Execute (a.out that gcc made): 
    
    ./a.out 

Try making new file /* This will make "example.txt" file in the current directory. */ 
    
    ./a.out
    mkfile example.txt
    exit                         /*this command will close the program*/
 
Instead "mkfile" you can try:
   
    mkdir, cp, rm, rmdir, info, insert, cat.
